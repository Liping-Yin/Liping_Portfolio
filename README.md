# My Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of projects and exercises completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. My main interets including data analysis and webdevelopment. Data analysis is presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.

### Data Analysis Practice
- Artifitial Intelligence Basic
 
  - [Decision Trees](https://github.com/icylove12/Liping_Portfolio/blob/main/decision%20trees/Week_4%20_ML_Decision_Trees.ipynb)<br>
  split dataset by decision tree which is based on entropy and information gain: write functions to calculate entropy and information gain, and functions to  get the feature that maximizes information gain and use this feature to split the dataset.In the end, compare the Iterative Dichotomiser 3 and Sklearn decisiontreeclassifier.
  - [Markov Decision Processs](https://github.com/icylove12/Liping_Portfolio/blob/main/Markov%20Decision%20Processes.ipynb)<br>
   Implement Markov Decision Process which provides a mathematical framework for modeling decision making, and it is useful for studying optimization problems by dynamic programming. In this practice, the MDP is based on utility, and in the end find the optimal policy for a classic environment wih 9 cells .
  - [Probalistic Reasoning](https://github.com/icylove12/Liping_Portfolio/blob/main/probabilistic%20reasoning.ipynb)

- Projects
  - [Machine Learning in NetSecure NIDS](https://github.com/icylove12/Liping_Portfolio/blob/main/The%20NetSecure%20NIDS/assignment.ipynb)
  - [Machine learning_ Kaggle Titanic survival prediction](https://github.com/icylove12/Liping_Portfolio/blob/main/Titanic%20Survival%20Prediction.ipynb)
### Web Development Practice
